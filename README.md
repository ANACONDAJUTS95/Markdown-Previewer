# Markdown-Previewer

This is a Markdown Previewer project, originally inspired by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). The goal of this project is to create a simple, responsive interface where users can input Markdown and see a live preview of how it will render in HTML.

## Project Overview

The Markdown Previewer allows you to write Markdown text in a text editor on the left side of the screen and see the rendered HTML output on the right side. This tool is useful for learning Markdown or for quickly previewing how your Markdown content will look when rendered on a webpage.

## Features

- **Real-time Markdown Rendering**: The preview updates automatically as you type.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: The layout is designed to be minimalistic, focusing on usability and readability.
- **Basic Markdown Support**: Supports headers, lists, links, text decorations, images, blockquotes, code, and code blocks.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I also explored how the `extends` keyword in JavaScript is used to enhance or modify existing classes, although in this project, the focus was on using plain JavaScript to achieve the desired functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/markdown-previewer.git```
